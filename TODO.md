- Repository Pattern
- Value Object Pattern
- Aggregate Root Pattern

### Performance Considerations
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for performance
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Lazy loading where appropriate

### Security Considerations
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Authentication and authorization
